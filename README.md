# Data-Structure
This file contains two data structures; Tuples and Stacks

## Stacks
Is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed.
The order might be LIFO(last in first out) or FILO(first in last out)
All insertions and deletes can occur only at the top of the stack.
Only one element can be pushed or popped from the stack at a time.

## Tuples
It is a data structure that consists of an ordered collection of elements.
They are indexed
Tuples are ordered
They are immutable
They can contain duplicate items.
Values are separated by a comma.
